This document defines a transition mechanism for using new hash algorithms 
when providing hashed authenticated denial of existence in a zone. The transition mechanism
defines a new digest type for Delegation Signer (DS) Resource
Records (RRs) that points to extra data embedded in the digest to 
include the type of authenticated denial used in the zone.
